# ml_models_from_scratch
I am going to try making machine learning models from scratch to understand the concept better and to be able to apply it.

### What I hope to learn and make from scratch:

##### Linear Regression
##### Logistic Regression
##### Descision Trees
##### Naive Bayes
##### Artificial Neural Networks
